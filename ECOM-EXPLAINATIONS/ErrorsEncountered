'await' expressions are only allowed within async functions and at the top levels of modules

tailwind version issue

1. 'await' expressions are only allowed within async functions and at the top levels of modules
   - This error occurs when trying to use await without marking the function as async
   - Solution: Add async keyword before the function where await is being used
   
2. Tailwind version issue
   - Incompatibility between Tailwind CSS versions and other dependencies
   - Solution: Ensure Tailwind CSS version matches the project requirements and other dependencies

3. React Router DOM v6 syntax differences
   - Switch component replaced with Routes in v6
   - Component prop replaced with element prop
   - Solution: Updated to use Routes and element syntax as shown in App.jsx

4. State management synchronization
   - State updates not reflecting immediately due to React's asynchronous nature
   - Solution: Use useEffect or proper state management patterns

5. CSS z-index stacking context
   - Elements with z-index not stacking as expected
   - Solution: Ensure proper nesting and relative/absolute positioning of elements

6. Responsive design breakpoints
   - Layout issues at different screen sizes
   - Solution: Utilize Tailwind's responsive classes and test across various devices
