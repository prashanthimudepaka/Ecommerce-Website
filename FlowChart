acccess tokens:
 create a new req in postman and check in redis to get refresh token 
 attempting to store a **refresh token** for a user in **Redis**, which is an in-memory data store. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:

1. **Identifying the User**  
   - The system logs that it is storing a refresh token for a user identified by an `ObjectId('67c6a875e051472830dedbed')`.  
   - This suggests the use of **MongoDB**, as `ObjectId` is a common identifier format in MongoDB.

2. **Checking Redis Connectivity**  
   - The log shows `Redis ping result: PONG`, confirming that Redis is reachable and responding.

3. **Storing the Token in Redis**  
   - The Redis key being used is `refreshToken:67c6a875e051472830dedbed`, meaning the refresh token is stored using the user's ID as part of the key.

4. **Verifying Storage Success**  
   - The log confirms that the Redis store operation returned `OK`, meaning the token was successfully saved.
   - It also checks and verifies that the token exists (`true`).

5. **Final Confirmation**  
   - The last log statement confirms that the **refresh token has been successfully stored in Redis**.

### **Purpose**
The primary goal of this process is to **store and manage refresh tokens** securely using Redis. This is commonly done in authentication systems to:
- Allow users to **refresh their authentication sessions** without logging in again.
- Improve performance by using Redis as a fast, in-memory cache instead of querying a database.
- Ensure **secure and quick access** to authentication tokens.

This is typically used in **JWT-based authentication** where access tokens have a short lifespan, and refresh tokens are stored to generate new ones.

During **signup (registration)**, authentication involves verifying and securely storing user credentials. The log you provided suggests that the system is implementing a **token-based authentication mechanism**, likely using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with **refresh tokens**.

Here’s how this fits into the **signup authentication process**:

### **1. User Signs Up**
- The user submits their details (email, username, password, etc.).
- The backend:
  - Hashes the password (e.g., using bcrypt).
  - Stores the user details in a **database** (likely MongoDB, based on the `ObjectId` in your log).

### **2. System Generates Tokens**
- Once the user is successfully registered, the system generates:
  - **Access Token:** A short-lived token (used for authentication in API requests).
  - **Refresh Token:** A long-lived token (used to obtain a new access token without re-login).

### **3. Storing Refresh Token in Redis**
- The refresh token is stored in **Redis** for quick access and validation.
- Your log confirms this:
  - `Redis store result: OK` → The refresh token is successfully stored.
  - `Verified stored token exists: true` → The system confirms it’s saved properly.

### **4. User Receives Tokens**
- The **access token** is sent to the user (usually stored in local storage or cookies).
- The **refresh token** is stored securely (often in an HTTP-only cookie).

### **5. Future Authentication Requests**
- When the user logs in again or the access token expires, the system:
  - Checks Redis for the refresh token.
  - Issues a new access token if the refresh token is valid.

### **Why Store Refresh Tokens in Redis?**
- **Faster authentication** compared to querying a database.
- **Easy revocation** (e.g., if a user logs out, the token can be deleted instantly).
- **Improved security** by reducing exposure of sensitive data.

### **Final Answer**
In the **signup authentication process**, storing the refresh token in Redis ensures that users can stay logged in without repeatedly entering credentials. It plays a key role in managing **session persistence** and improving authentication efficiency.
